**Presentation**

My presentation is about Walt Disney and how he grew up, as well as how he eventually founded Disney Brothers' Studios and created iconic films relevant even today. My presentation is broken up into Walt Disney's early childhood biography, early cartoons, commercial success, and legacy. It can be found [here](https://github.com/melissafu/melissafu-presentation). Furthermore, a loose script can be found [here](https://github.com/melissafu/melissafu-presentation/blob/master/waltdisney.md).
