# **Overall Experience**
### I found making a website based on a template to be *more* challenging than making one from scratch. I think building one from the base up is easier in the sense that I have full control and knowledge of where everything is. I have web development experience so editing the files wasn't that much of an issue. The more difficult and time-consuming part was trying to find where all the files were and what features referred to which part of the website.

# What I've Learned
* Update the git repo from a terminal
  * Prior to this class, the only way I knew how to update my website was by making manual changes to my files on the github website. I now feel comfortable with using codeanywhere so programming from the shell with git commands makes doesn't seem so foreign to me anymore.
